    <h1>What is Box Model In CSS?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="What">The CSS Box Model defines how elements on a webpage are structured and sized. It consists of four parts: content (the element's actual content), padding (space around the content), border (surrounds the padding), and margin (space outside the border). The Box Model helps control layout by determining how these areas are measured, and the `box-sizing` property allows developers to include or exclude padding and borders from an element's total width and height.

    <h1>Who Invented Box Model In CSS?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="who">
        The CSS Box Model was not invented by a single person but was a collective design decision made by the creators of the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) specification. It was developed as part of the evolution of CSS to solve the problem of how elements should be sized and spaced on a web page.
<br><br>
        The Box Model became a fundamental part of CSS when it was introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). which is responsible for standardizing web technologies. Specifically, the concept was included in the CSS1 specification, published in 1996. HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, who was one of the key figures in the creation of CSS, played a significant role in the development of CSS in general, including the Box Model.</p>
